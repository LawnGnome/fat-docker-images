_Fat Ubuntu images, you make the rockin' world go round..._

# x86-64 and armhf Docker images in a single repository

This tool uses the support for fat manifests added in Docker's
[version 2 schema](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/) and
the extremely nifty [manifest-tool](https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool) to
build a set of Docker Hub repositories that bundle the x86-64 and armhf
repositories for useful tools into single repositories.

This is very convenient if you're building Dockerised microservices for a
Raspberry Pi but want to be able to run them on your x86-64 development machine
as well for easier development and debugging.

## Repositories currently generated by this tool:

* [`lawngnome/alpine`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lawngnome/alpine)
* [`lawngnome/python`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lawngnome/python)
* [`lawngnome/redis`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lawngnome/redis)
* [`lawngnome/ubuntu`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lawngnome/ubuntu)

All repositories currently support x86-64 and armhf. Only tags available on all
architectures will be pushed.

## How do I use these images?

You can use these like the official repositories.

For instance, on x86-64, you can use `lawngnome/ubuntu` as a drop in
replacement for the normal `ubuntu` image:

```
adam@x86-64:~$ docker run -it --rm lawngnome/ubuntu:xenial 
root@9cbbef46747e:/# uname -a
Linux 9cbbef46747e 4.8.13-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Dec 9 07:24:34 CET 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
root@9cbbef46747e:/# cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS \n \l
```

Similarly, on armhf, you can use `lawngnome/ubuntu` as a drop in replacement
for `armhf/ubuntu`:

```
adam@armhf:~$ docker run -it --rm lawngnome/ubuntu:xenial
root@7d7a6ad94c98:/# uname -a
Linux 7d7a6ad94c98 4.1.18-v7+ #846 SMP Thu Feb 25 14:22:53 GMT 2016 armv7l armv7l armv7l GNU/Linux
root@7d7a6ad94c98:/# cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS \n \l
```

(Yes, I should probably update the kernel on my Raspberry Pi.)

## How often are these images updated?

I've got a script on a server that should update this weekly. Generally
speaking, the actual underlying images do not actually update that often;
please check their respective Docker Hub pages for their last update times.

## How do I build these images?

You'll need to build the `bin/update` binary: if you have Go 1.6 or later
installed, that should just involve running `make`.

You'll also need the `manifest` binary created by building
[manifest-tool](https://github.com/estesp/manifest-tool).

And, finally, you'll need to be able to write to each target image defined in
`repos.yml`.

Assuming you have all that:

```
./bin/update -repos repos.yml -manifest /path/to/manifest
```

should get it done.
